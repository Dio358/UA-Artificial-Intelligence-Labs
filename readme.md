### Class structure

The labs are slit in two parts:

- **Hour 1** (Optional QnA):

  Time to continue working on your project, and ask for questions/tips when stuck.

- **Hour 2** Conventional Lab:

  We do exercises together.



**Example lab session:**

- We make the first few exercises together in class (see *"Lab exercises"*) below. 

- The exercises under *"Graded Homework"* are part of your project. 
  It is **highly recommended** to solve these exercises before the next lab session. 

  Succeeded? 

  - Yes? Great, you can come an hour later next week's lab session. 
  - No? No worries, you can continue on them in next week's lab practical (hour 1) and ask for questions or tips if needed.

**Warning:**

- !! Each project will consist of exercises from ~3 lab sessions... do not procrastinate. Start working on them immediately after the lab session, so that the workload is nicely distributed over the semester and you have time to ask questions. !!
